# Intro to GitHub Markdown
This is a _markdown_ file. The syntax is pretty basic. Here's a quick overview:
- You can create a bulleted list by starting a new line with a hyphen -
- You can create headers of different levels by starting lines with different numbers of #'s.
Check out examples throughout this file.
- You can make text **bold** by surrounding it by double asterisks ( \** ), and
_italic_ by surrounding it with underscores ( _ ).
